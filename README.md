# Traveling-Salesman-Solutions
A Project I did at some point during my Sophomore year to help my brother with an assignment. Two different algorithms for finding good, but not necessarily optimal paths for the traveling salesmen problem.

The traveling salesmen problem is a problem in which a salesmen has to visit every point on a euclidian graph and then return to the originol point by moving the smallest possible distance. To solve this perfectly would require exponentially large amounts of computing power for larger and largers graphs (O(n!), advanced solutions can do it in O(n^2 * 2 ^ n), so diffrent algorithms have been made to pick solutions that are pretty good, but probably not perfect. These run very fast even on large graphs.
